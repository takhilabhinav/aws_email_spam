## Outline:

## Implement a Machine Learning model for predicting whether an SMS message is spam or not.
-Follow the following AWS tutorial on how to build and train a spam filter machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker: https://github.com/aws-samples/reinvent2018-srv404-lambda-sagemaker/ blob/master/training/README.md
-The resulting model should perform well on emails as well, which is what the rest of the assignment will focus on.
-Deploy the resulting model to an endpoint (E1).
